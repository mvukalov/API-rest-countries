## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The application fetches country data from the REST Countries API.
2. All countries are displayed in a table format.
3. Clicking on a country navigates to a dynamic details page.
4. The country code (cca3) is used for reliable routing and API requests.
5. Data is rendered dynamically with safe fallbacks for missing values.
